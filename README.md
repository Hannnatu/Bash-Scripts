The file `lala.sh` is a Bash script that checks if a specific port (in this case, port 22) is open or closed on the system. 

### Summary:
1. The script uses `netstat` to check if port 22 is active.
2. If the port is open, it outputs: `"Port 22 is open."`
3. If the port is closed, it outputs: `"Port 22 is closed."`

This script can be useful for quickly verifying the status of a port (commonly used for SSH).
